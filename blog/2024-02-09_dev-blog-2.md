Hello all!

I've been working on some improvements/additions to the website, and I figured I should let everybody know about them.

## 1. Presentations

The first and biggest update is that I intend to start adding presentations to the server in the near future. These will likely range in length from around fifteen slides to over one hundred and cover many different topics. For the longer ones, I am considering experimenting with a pay-for-access system, but I have not made a decision yet. Most of them will cover simple, bite-sized topics.

## 2. Pages

I added an ABOUT page to the website accessible through the menu bar. The page contains a little background about the project, contact information, and acknowledgments. I am sure that this will change in design and scope in the future.

I also added a drop-down menu to the ARTICLES menu item to make it easier to find specific articles.

### 3. Collaborations

I am currently in talks with other Icelandic language makers/content creators concerning some features and collaborations with the project. I am looking to shout out some other resources and perhaps host some exclusive interviews with them that would be posted here. I am very excited about this possibility and would be very excited to make such collaborations a semi-regular feature of the project.
