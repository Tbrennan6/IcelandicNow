Hello everybody!

This is the first post in a new series called "You Should Know." You can view all other posts in this series Here.

The series is mostly aimed at Icelandic learners who are just starting to enter the intermediate phase. At this level, one of the biggest struggles is having the functional vocabulary necessary to read books, talk with others, and just generally make good use of the language.

While it's important to know classic beginner verbs like "Að sjá" and "Að tala," to engage with native material and speakers, you have to expand your knowledge. This series will help with that!

All of the following verbs are extremely common and can be used in many different contexts, but they often fall outside the core beginner canon of verbs.

*Note: No midvoice, impersonal, or phrasal verbs will be covered in this list. These will each get their own dedicated post!*

### 10. Eyða

"Að eyða" means either "To destroy" or "To spend" depending on the context. It is most commonly used to talk about spending/wasting time or money on things, something that everybody does every day.

1. Ekki eyða peningum í föt. - (Don't spend money on clothes.)
2. Hvernig á ég að eyða tímanum mínum? - (How should I spend my time?)
3. Hún eyddi deginum á Íslandi. - (She spent the day in Iceland.)

### 9. Nenna (dat)

"Að nenna" is a word that is slightly difficult to translate into English but is one that Icelanders use all the time. It means something along the lines of "To be bothered to" and "To be willing to." It is by far most common with first-person or second-person subjects and with a negative adverb like "Ekki," but it can also be used to ask for small favors.

1. Ég nenni ekki að keyra í fjórar klukkustundir. - (I can't be bothered to drive for four hours.)
2. Ég ætlaði út í búð en nennti því ekki. - (I was going to go to the store, but I couldn't be bothered.)
3. Nennirðu að tala við hana? - (Can I bother you to talk with her?)

### 8. Missa (acc)

"Að missa" means either "To drop something accidentally" or "To lose something/someone," either literally or figuratively, depending on the context.

1. Ég missti bollann. - (I dropped the cup.)
2. Hann missti íbúðina sína. - (He lost his apartment.)
3. Konan missti pabba sinn. - (The woman lost her father.)

### 7. Veita (dat + acc)

The only ditransitive verb to make the list, "Að veita" is a combination of "To give," "To provide," and "To offer." Beginner learners always learn "Að gefa" which is often synonymous, but seemingly never learn "Að veita," which is also very common.

1. Hún veitti mér upplýsinga. - (She provided me with information.)
2. Hann veitir honum hjálp. - (He offers him help.)
3. Hótelið veitti slæma þjónustu. - (The hotel offered bad service.)

### 6. Skoða (acc)

"Að skoða" is best thought of to mean "To carefully take a look at" or "To observe." It can be used to refer to things online, sites, information, and much more.

1. Vill einhver skoða myndbandið? - (Does anyone want to look at the video?)
2. Hann skoðar sjálfan sig í speglinum. - (He looks at himself in the mirror.)
3. Skoðaðu bókina. - (Check out the book.)

### 5. Breyta (dat)

"Að breyta" means "To change." Just be sure not to change the word order around; If the subject is the thing that changes instead of the object, the verb "Að breytast" must be used instead.

1. Ég breytti nafninu mínu. - (I changed my name.)
2. Fallið breytir merkingunni. - (The case changes the meaning.)
3. Hún breytti uppskriftinni. - (She changed the recipe.)

### 4. Líta (til staðar)

"Að líta" means "To look/glance at." Often, beginners will learn "Að horfa," which is slightly more intense in meaning.

1. Barnið leit á móður sína. - (The child looked at its mother.)
2. Nemandinn leit á klukkuna - (The student looked at the clock.)
3. Líttu á matseðilinn. (Look at the menu.)

### 3. Vona

"Að vona" is best translated as "To hope." The next verb following "Að vona" needs to be subjunctive.

1. Ég vona að ég nái prófinu. - (I hope I pass the exam.)
2. Hann vonar að veðrið lagast fljótt. - (He hopes the weather gets better soon.)
3. Hún vonaði að hann kæmi. - (She hopes that he will come.)

### 2. Ákveða (acc)

"Að ákveða" means "to decide." You can decide a matter, or you can decide to do something.

1. Þú einn ákveður það. - (You alone decide that.)
2. Hákarl ákvað að elta okkur. - (A shark decided to follow us.)
3. Hún ákvað að fara. - (She decided to go.)

### 1. Halda

"Að halda" is one of the many verbs in Icelandic that is used to talk about what you think, and it is likely the most common of them all. It is used to talk about things that you believe to be factually true. This is opposed to opinions or beliefs, which is where "Að finnast" and "Að telja" come in. The next verb following "Að halda" needs to be subjunctive.

1. Ég held að það sé satt. - (I think that's true.)
2. Heldurðu að ég hafi valið að búa hér? - (Do you think I chose to live here?)
3. Ég held að þetta sé ekki íslenska. (I think that's not Icelandic.)
