title: Hello and Goodbye
---

Perhaps the most important thing to learn in any language is how to say *hello* and *goodbye*. 

As in any language, there are many ways to say *hello* and *goodbye* in Icelandic. However, not all of these methods are used all the time. Instead, they depend on the time of day, degree of formality, and, in Icelandic, the gender(s) of the person(s) addressed.

## Time Sensitive Greetings

Icelandic uses different greetings at different times of the day. Saying *góðan daginn* perhaps the most famous Icelandic expression of all time, at midnight would be as weird as saying *good day* to somebody at midnight.

Just like English, many of these greetings are created by blending a time of day with an adjective (a word used to describe a noun). Later in the course, you will learn a little more about why these words take the forms that they do. For now, it would be best to just memorize the greetings below in their entirety.

Below are the most common time-sensitive greetings. The options given are all extremely common and can be used interchangeably with one another. 

| greetings | **Day** | **Night** |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Option 1**   | góðan daginn      | góða kvöldið      |
| **Option 2**   | góðan dag      | gott kvöld      |
| **Option 3**   | daginn     | kvöldið      |

Person 1: Góðan daginn! - (Good day!)
Person 2: Daginn. - (Good day.)

Person 1: Gott kvöld. - (Good evening.)
Person 2: Kvöldið. - (Good evening.)

*Note 1:  While saying "good day" or "good evening" to somebody in English can be a little stilted and overly formal, this is not the case in Icelandic. Saying "góðan daginn" and its equivalents is very typical and normal sounding.*

*Note 2: "Icelandic does not have a comfortable translation for "good morning," such as is common in English. For this purpose, "góðan daginn" is used.*

## Formality Sensitive Greetings
Icelandic greetings can also depend on the level of formality. This happens in English as well. For instance, if you are talking with a superior at work or an older person in general, it would be common and respectful to use a more formal greeting than one you would use with your friends. You wouldn't, usually, say *wazzup* to your great-grandma or a company representative in a business meeting. Instead, you may choose to say something more formal, such as *hello*.
 
In Icelandic, a very formal and polite  greeting is *komdu sæll og blessaður*.

This phrase is very, very polite. Literally, it  means *come healthy and blessed.* It is often shortened in greetings to *komdu sæll,* *sæll og blessaður,* or most commonly simply *sæll* or *blessaður.* The general rule is that the longer the phrase, the more polite and formal it is. 

If you’re speaking to an older person for the first time, using the entire phrase would be more appropriate. If you are talking with a coworker, just *sæll* or *blessaður* is probably more appropriate. Using the whole phrase with a young person or a friend would be seen as strange and is sometimes done for comedic effect. 

Breaking it down, the phrase *komdu sæll og blessaður* makes use of two adjectives: *sæll* and *blessaður*. Getting a little ahead of ourselves, these adjectives must match the gender identity and number of the party or parties being addressed. As a result, you must use the forms of the adjectives that match who you are greeting. This holds for shortened forms as well. Below, see the forms that are approprite to use for each potential audience. Notice how both adjectives change depending on who is addressed.
