title: Introduction to Case Steering
---

By now, you should be fairly comfortable with the idea of subjects and objects. Whether a noun is a subject or an object and what verb it is effected by is a large part of deciding what case a noun needs to be.

## Subject 
When a nous is acting as a subject in Icelandic, it overwhelmingly needs to be in the nominative case. This is a basic rule that is only broken in specific circumstances. 

Example 1: **Hann** borðar. \
Exmaple 2: **Hún** borðar. \
Example 3: **Það** borðar. 

## Objects 
When a noun is acting as an object, it overwhelmingly needs to be in a case other than nominative: either accusative, dative, or genitive. These cases together are called the *additional cases*. 

There are two types of objects, direct objects and direct objects. 

### Direct Objects
Direct objects are objects that directly receive the action of the verb. 

Example: Ég baka honum **köku**. - (I bake him a **cake**. )

In the above sentence, the word **köku** is the direct object becuase it is directly receiving the action of the sentence's verb, *að baka*. It is the thing being baked.

What case a direct object needs to be in is determined by the verb itself. Unfortunately, there is no simple way to know what case a verb steers as its object. Most verbs steer the accusative case as their direct objects, but there are many exmples of verbs steering the dative case as their objects as well, and a few steer genitive as well. 

Typically, in a dictionary or wordlist, the direct object that the verb steers is denoted after the verb in parenthesis. 

Example: Bak/a (acc)

### Indirect Objects
Indirect objects are objects that are effected by the action, but it is not the direct object. Typically, direct objects are recipients. 

Example: Ég baka **honum** köku. - (I bake **him** a cake. )

In the above sentence, the word **honum** is the indirect object. It is not directly receiving the action of the sentence's verb, *baka*, but it is the recipient. It is the person who is receiving the cake.

Similarly to direct objects, what case an indirect object needs to be in is determined by the verb. Luckily, there is a very strong general rule that indirect objects to be in the dative case, but there are exceptions. 

Typically, dictionaries and wordlists will not denote what case an indirect object needs to be in unless it is not the indirect case. When this is done, the dative object is denoted in parenthesis after the verb before the direct object.

Example 1: bak/a (acc) \
Example 2: spry/ja (acc) (gen)

## No Objects
Don't make the mistake of thinking that all verbs need an object all the time. Only *transitive* verbs want objects. There are many verbs that never wnat any objects, known as *non-transitive* verbs. 

Example 1: að vakna - (to wake up) \
Example 2: að öskra - (to scream)


## Multiple Cases
Some verbs can accept a mixture of cases. When this happens, it is not because either case can serve the same meaning rather but because the difference in case changes the verb's meaning. 

Example 1: tak/a (acc) - (take, like with a hand) \
Example 2: tak/a (dat) - (take, like receive a suggestion)

## Now I Know:
- the difference between a subjct and an object
- what case steering is
- what cases subjects and objects are typically on
- how verbs control the case of their objects
