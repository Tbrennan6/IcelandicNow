title: Introduction to Declension
---

Now that you have a basic understanding of conjugation, it is time to learn some basics of declension. Declension is the inflection of nouns. For native English speakers, understanding how declension works is often cited as the hardest aspect of Icelandic grammar to master since there is not a great modern English example or phenomenon to compare it to. As a result, English speakers often quickly feel overwhelmed and have difficulty distinguishing when they should use one form of a word in Icelandic versus when they should be using another.


## What Is Declensoin
Declension is when a nominal (a noun, pronoun, or adjective) changes its form to fit a certain grammatical context or indicate an additional aspect.
