Welcome to *Icelandic For Beginners*!


First and foremost, I want to express my sincere gratitude to you for choosing my course as your guide on this exciting language-learning journey. 


My journey with Icelandic began in childhood. My grandmother, a native Icelander, immigrated to the United States with my grandfather after my mother and aunt were born. Although I wasn't taught the language as a child (I completely lacked any interest at that time), I have vivid memories of hearing Icelandic being spoken when my grandparents wanted to have private conversations without the grandchildren understanding their words. As the years went by, I found myself growing frustrated with using Google Translate to decipher the Facebook posts of distant relatives who still lived in Iceland. Eventually, I took a trip to Iceland and solidified my commitment to learning the language, and I have now been learning for years.


Despite my strong motivation, I encountered significant challenges when it came to finding suitable resources. Every book I purchased and every online course I enrolled in left me feeling unsatisfied in some way. They often failed to cover the topics I needed to understand or made things overly complicated and confusing, making my language-learning journey much more difficult than it needed to be. Years later, hoping to spare you the same frustration, I decided to create this course. 


I would like to acknowledge all of those who helped me create this course over the past months. Without their help, this project would not be where it is today. 


A special thank you to Lilja Rut, Max Schreifels, and Mr. Me.
