Now that you understand the idea behind inflection and understand how conjugation tables work, it is time to learn your first verb! The most important verb to know in any language is *to be*. In Icelandic, to be is *að vera*. 

## Regular and Irregular Verbs

*Að vera* and *to be* are irregular verbs. Most verbs are regular, meaning they follow a regular, expected pattern. For example, the verb *to bake*. *To bake* is a regular verb because it is conjugated exactly like you would expect an English verb to conjugate. Most notably, it adds **-ed** to form its past tense. Most other verbs do this, including *to talk*.

Example 1: To bake \
Example 2: I bake. \
Example 3: I bak**ed**. \
Example 4: To talk \
Example 5: I talk.\
Example 6: I talk**ed**.

Irregular verbs do not follow a regular pattern like this. In English, *to be* and *to eat* are two examples of irregular verbs. These verbs are irregular because their past tense forms do not follow an expected pattern. 

Example 1: To be \
Example 1: I am. \
Example 2: I was. \
Example 3: To eat \
Example 3: I eat. \
Example 4: I ate. 

## To  Be
Below, see the entire chart for *to be.* *To be* is a unique verb in English because it is completely irregular; none of its forms look anything like the infinitive! It is also unique because it has five unique forms when most verbs have only three. Also of note is how the present tense and the past tense forms do not share anything in common. 

| Pres. be | **Sing.** | **Plur.** |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **1st.** | am        | are       |
| **2nd.** | are       | are       |
| **3rd.** | is        | are       |

| Past be  | **Sing.** | **Plur.** |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **1st.** | was       | were      |
| **2nd.** | were      | were      |
| **3rd.** | was       | were      |

*Tip: For some people, it's hard to wrap their brains around the fact that "am" and "were" are technically the same word. But fear not; this is completely normal and part of the learning process! It may be helpful to mentally walk through the "to be" chart in your head a couple of times. Try making the equivalent of "he is" using "I" as the subject, and then move on to the other subjects, too.*

## Að Vera

*Að vera* is completely irrregular. In practice, this means that you have to remember its forms by heart. While this may seem intimidating, *að vera* is such a common verb that trying to avoid it would do more harm than good. 

| Pres. vera | **Sing.** | **Plur.** |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| **1st.**   | er        | erum      |
| **2nd.**   | ert       | eruð      |
| **3rd.**   | er        | eru      |

| Past vera | **Sing.** | **Plur.** |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| **1st.**   | var       | vorum     |
| **2nd.**   | varst     | voruð     |
| **3rd.**   | var       | voru      |

*Tip: Try to find patterns in the conjugation chart that make it easier to remember. For example, did you notice that every past tense form starts with a "v" and every present tense form starts with an "e"? There are many other smaller patterns like that that you can and should spend some time discovering on your own.*

*Tip: You don't need to memorize the entire chart right now, but it would be helpful to do so. If, after the first unit, you are still having considerable trouble, consider practicing filling out the table a couple of times on [Íslenzka.is](https://islenzka.is/aefingar/leita.html)*.
