title: Þetta, Hver, and Hvað
---

Þetta, Hvað, and Hver allow you to identify things. 

## Þetta

*Þetta* is the neuter singular form of the demonstrative pronoun, *þessi*. While its overall usages are a bit more complete, for now, all you need to know is that you use *þetta* to identify something. For this exact purpose, English uses the words *this*, *that*, *these*, and *those*, but Icelandic just uses *þetta*. Unlike in English, Icelandic doesn't differentiate between close things (*this* and *these*) and things that are far away (*that* and *those*). 

Example 1: Þetta er penni. - (This is a pen.) \
Example 2: Þetta er tölva. - (This is a computer.) \
Example 3: Þetta eru penni og tölva. - (These are a pen and a computer.)

In *example 3*, you likely noticed that the form *eru* is used instead of *er*. This is done because there are two words on the other side of the verb. As you can see by the English translation, the same thing happens in English. 

## Hvað and Hver

*Hvað* is a special form of the word *hver*. For these basic identifying sentences, you can think of *hvað* as meaning *what*, and *hver* as meaning *who*. 

Example 1: Hvað er þetta? - (What is that?) \
Example 2: Hver er þetta? - (Who is that?)

*Note: You can only use "hver" to ask who a single person is.* More about *hver* will be revealed in a future lesson. 

## Now I know:
- how to identify something using *þetta* 
- how to ask what something is using *hvað* 
- how to ask who somebody is using *hver*
