title: Introduction to Conjugation
---

The first kind of inflection that you are going to learn is conjugation. Conjugation is the inflection of verbs, and it is a kind of inflection that is present in both English and Icelandic. 

## How Do Icelandic Verbs Inflect?

In English, verbs are conjugated depending on who the subject (the doer of the verb) is and when the action happened. If the subject is *he*, *she*, or *it*, then the verb adds an **-s**. 

Example 1: I speak.\
Example 2: He speak**s**.\
Example 3: I bake.\
Example 4: She bake**s**.

Icelandic does a pretty similar thing. When the subject of the verb is *hann*, *hun*, or *það*, then the verb is usually going to add an **-r**.

Example 1: Ég tala. \
Example 2: Hann tala**r**.\
Example 3: Ég baka.\
Example 4: Hann baka**r**. 

While verbs can change depending on their person, they can also change depending on when they occur; this is known as tense. In English, when something happens in the past instead of the present, the verb usually adds **-ed** no matter who the speaker is.

Example 1: I talk.\
Example 2: I talk**ed**.\
Example 3: She bakes.\
Example 4: She bak**ed**.

Icelandic does a pretty similar thing again. When the action of the verb takes place in the past, Icelandic usually adds an ending. 

Example 1: Ég tala.\
Example 2: Ég tal**aði**.\
Example 3: Það bakar.\
Example 4: Það bak**aði**.

As mentioned in the previous lesson, Icelandic verbs conjugate more and more complexly than English ones. Below, see a table comparing inflection in English and Icelandic for the same verb. At this point, do not worry about trying to memorize the chart. Your only job is to notice how the patterns in Icelandic are more complex than in English and then answer the questions thereafter.  

|              | English Present | Icelandic Present | English Past | Icelandic Past |
|:------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|
|    **I / Ég**    |       bake      |        baka       |     bak**ed**    |     bak**aði**     |
|   **You / Þú**   |       bake      |       bak**ar**       |     bak**ed**    |     bak**aðir**    |
|  **He\* / Hann\*** |       bake**s**      |       bak**ar**       |     bak**ed**    |     bak**aði**     |
|  **We / Við**    |       bake      |      bök**um**\**      |     bak**ed**    |    bök**uðum**\**   |
|  **Y'all / Þið**  |       bake      |       bak**ið**       |     bak**ed**    |    bök**uðuð**\**   |
| **They / Þeir\*** |       bake      |        baka       |     bak**ed**    |    bök**uðu**\**    |

*These subjects are hiding other versions depending on gender. You will learn more about these subjects in the lesson *conjugation charts*. 
**These words are experiencing umlaut. You will learn more about umlaut in a later lesson. 

Using the chart above, translate the following into Icelandic:
1. He bakes. 
2. We baked. 
3. I bake. 
4. I baked. 
5. Y'all baked. 

## Now I know:
- the Icelandic words for *I*, *you*, *he*, *she*, *it*, *we, *y'all*, and *they*
- Icelandic verbs conjugate
- Icelandic conjugation depends on subject and tense





























































































Declension is when a nominal (a noun, pronoun, or adjective) changes its form to fit a certain grammatical context or indicate an additional aspect, such as number. For native English speakers, understanding how declension works is often cited as the hardest aspect of Icelandic grammar to master since there is not a great modern English example or phenomenon to compare it to. As a result, English speakers often quickly feel overwhelmed and have difficulty distinguishing when they should use one form of a word in Icelandic versus when they should be using another.

## Declension in English

While there are only up to four possible forms for each nominal in English, there are up to sixteen different forms in Icelandic. There are so many more forms because modern Icelandic has maintained a rigid four-case system while modern English has nearly abandoned cases altogether. Fortunately, a remnant of the English case system still exists with some pronouns (words that stand in for nouns. ex: *he*, *she*, *you*), which can be used to draw a good comparison with the Icelandic system.


Consider the following two examples:


Example 1: I talk to you.

Example 2: I talk to he.


While Example 1 is perfectly grammatical, Example 2 is not. Without me telling you, your brain can sense that the word he is what was wrong with the sentence, even if you don't know why. What's more, your brain also probably told you that you have to say *him* in that second example instead of *he*.


Before I explain why that is, take a second to ask yourself why *he* does not work in Example 2, but *him* would. Don't both words mean exactly the same thing?


The answer is that your brain, even if you don’t realize it, is very good at English grammar and knows that *he* and *him* fill different grammatical niches.


The pronoun *he*, along with a few others such as *I*, *she*, and *we*, fills a certain grammatical niche that *him* cannot: being used as the subjects (a noun that performs the action of verbs). All pronouns that can fill this niche can be swapped in for one another in nearly any sentence, and that sentence will still make sense grammatically. These pronouns that fill this niche are called the English subject pronouns, and for the sake of comparison to Icelandic, we can think of all these pronouns as being part of one case.


Example 1: **We** see a horse.

Example 2: **She** sees a horse.

Example 3: **I** see a horse.


Notice how in the three sentences above, the highlighted words represent the entities performing the action of the verb. They are the ones doing the seeing, so they are the subjects of the verb.


These pronouns have separate forms, such as *me*, *her*, and *us*, that represent the same basic ideas and nouns as the subject pronouns. However, these versions can not be the subjects of verbs. Instead, they have to be objects (a noun that receives the action of the verb). These are the English object pronouns, and we can think of them as part of a second separate case.


Example 1: A horse sees **him**.

Example 2: A horse sees **her**.

Example 3: A horse sees **me**.


Notice how in the three sentences above, the highlighted words are not performing the action of seeing as before but are rather the things being seen. They are the object of the verb now instead of the subject. What word is acting as the subject?


Even though the two different forms of these words represent the same noun(s), you can never use them interchangeably. That is the heart of declension: different forms are used to represent different ideas in relation to the same noun.


While nouns change for case, they also change for number. Just as you can not use *she* and *her* interchangeably, you can not use *she* and *they* interchangeably either: the meaning changes again. When you say *they*, you are no longer talking about one *she*, instead you are talking about many "She"s all together.


The two criteria we discussed, case and number, form the basis of organizing nouns into declension tables, a way to show the different forms of a word neatly. The vertical axis of declension tables is organized by case, and the horizontal axis by number. To find the form of a word in a specific case and number, simply find the cell at the intersection of the two axes.


Below, see the declension pattern of the pronoun "She." There are two unique forms for singular (one thing) and two separate unique forms for plural (multiple thing).

||**Singular**|**Plural**|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Case 1**|she|they|
|**Case 2**|her|them|

Similar charts can be made for any nominal in English that we desire. Think about how this chart would look if it were filled in with the pronouns *I* or *he* in the top left instead of *she*. How would the rest of the chart look?


While some pronouns, such as *she*, have all these unique forms, all nouns and some of the other pronouns, such as *you*, do not. Typically, there is a slightly different form for the plural instances, but all the singulars and plurals will look exactly like each other. That is why the sentences "*You talk to a horse*," and "*A horse talks to you*," are both perfectly grammatical, even though the nominals are swapping positions. The word *you* and the word horse both use the same form for the role of the subject and the object, cases one and two.


Below, see the declension pattern of the pronoun *you* and the noun horse.

||**Singular**|**Plural**|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Case 1**|you|y'all|
|**Case 2**|you|y'all|

||**Singular**|**Plural**|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Case 1**|horse|horses|
|**Case 2**|horse|horses|

## Declension in Icelandic

Icelandic has four cases instead of two, and nearly every nominal has a different form in every case and number, not just some pronouns.


Below, see the declension pattern of the word *hestur* which means *horse*.

|**Hest/ur (-s, ar)**|**Singular**|**Plural**|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Nominative**|hestur|hestar|
|**Accusative**|hest|hesta|
|**Dative**|hesti|hestum|
|**Genitive**|hests|hesta|


The Icelandic cases have recognized names. In English, these are called nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive. While it could be tempting to try to derive meanings from the names of these cases, this should not be done; rather, their names should just be taken at face value. The names do not affect anything in themselves; they are simply a way to refer to their respective forms. The cases could be called case 1, case 2, case 3, and case 4, or anything else for that matter, and nothing would functionally change.


*Note: It is impossible to write a noun without a case or number. It always has to be in one of each.*


Since nouns always have to be in a case and number, the nominative singular form is used to talk about a noun in a non-grammatical context, such as when it appears by itself on a sign, when the word is being discussed in another language, or when the word is written in the dictionary.


In a declension table, the nominative singular form appears a second time in the top left cell. Often, this form has a slash through it. This is done to show what word the table is examining and to help illustrate the declining process. The slash separates the stem of the word, the part that usually stays the same during declension, on the left from the ending, the part that usually changes, on the right.


Because the stem of the word usually stays the same during declension, we can identify the word and thus know what it means despite the changes in the ending. For example, notice how every form of the word *hestur* contains the stem, *hest*. Since this is the case, you know that any word starting with *hest* is going to be some form of the word *hestur*.


It is worth noting that the same form can repeat within a word paradigm, such as the form *hesta* appearing both as the plural accusative and genitive.

## Why decline in Icelandic?

The reason why Icelandic words need to be in one case as opposed to the other is not as simple as the difference between a subject and an object as it is in English. The later lesson, Introduction to Case-Steering, will discuss the usages of the cases in more detail.


Please note that the ending pattern that *hestur* follows is only one of the many declension patterns present in Icelandic. This may seem extremely intimidating, especially if you have never encountered declension before, but over time, the patterns can be learned, and the process of declension will become more natural.


The important thing to take away from this lesson is the knowledge that Icelandic nouns are going to change based on grammatical context and that most of these changes will happen in the ending.
