title: Conjugation Charts

While the ideas of conjugation and inflection may seem intimidating and confusing at first, fear not! Tools and patterns are available that can help you memorize and internalize the ideas behind inflection. 

## What Is A Conjugation Chart?
Using conjugation charts is the standard way in which the different forms of a word are displayed. They can be organized by different characteristics called aspects, but the standard way to organize them--and the way this course will do so unless otherwise noted--is by *person* and *plurality* with one chart for the present and one chart for the past tense.  

*Note: Verbs also inflect differently depending on the characteristics of mood, voice, personal or impersonal usage, and more, and different charts can be used to reflect these characteristics. These additional aspects are not addressed further in this course because they are not important for the beginner to know and would become unduly complicated.* 

| pres. bake | **Sing.** | **Plur.** |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| **1st.**   | bake      | bake      |
| **2nd.**   | bake      | bake      |
| **3rd.**   | bakes     | bake      |

| past bake | **Sing.** | **Plur.** |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **1st.**  | baked     | baked     |
| **2nd.**  | baked     | baked     |
| **3rd.**  | baked     | baked     |

## The Elements Of A Conjugation Chart 
Person and plurality refer to how close the subject of the verb is to the person creating the sentence and whether that subject is a single person or a group. 

| subjects | **Sing.**  | **Plur.**   |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **1st.** | I          | we / við    |
| **2nd.** | you        | y'all / þið |
| **3rd.** | he* / hann* | they / þeir |

The subjects *I* and *we* are both first person because they are as close to the speaker as possible. When you use *I* or *we*, you are referring to an action that you did or a group including yourself. The subjects *you* and *y'all* are the next level away. You use them when you are directly addressing somebody or a group. The subjects *he* and *they* are the furthest away. When you use them, you are referring to a person or group abstractly. 

*I*, *you*, and *he* are singular because they only refer to one individual. *We*, *y'all*, and *they* are plural because they refer to multiple people. 

## A Note On *He* And *Hann* 
As you have likely noticed, the subjects *he* and *hann* are accompanied by asterisks in conjugations charts throughout this course. This is done because they could be swapped for other words. The words *he* and *hann* have been chosen because they are standardly used in these tables alongside *she* and *it* or *hún* and *það*, and using only one of these words saves considerable tablespace. 

The word *he* in the conjugation chart could be replaced with any other singular noun, and the accompanying conjugation for that word as a subject would be correct. This includes she, it, John, Eifel Tower, cat, computer, and anything else that you can think of. 

Example 1: He bakes. \
Example 2: She bakes. \
Example 3: It bakes. \
Example 4: John bakes. \
Example 5: The Eifel Tower bakes. 

The same is true of the word *hann (he). It could be replaced with any other singular noun in Icelandic, and the accompanying conjugation for that word as a subject would be correct.

Example 1: Hann bakar. \
Example 2: Hun borðar. \
Example 3: Það bakar. \
Example 4: Jón bakar. \
Example 5: Eiffel turninn bakar.

## A Note On Þeir
There is a similar story with *þeir* as there is to *he* and *han* with one twist. As you could probably guess, *þeir* could be swapped with any plural noun or two singular nouns, and the accompanying conjugation for that word as a subject would be correct. 

Example 1: Þeir baka - (They bake.) \
Example 2: Kettir baka. - (Cats bake.) \
Example 3: Tölvur baka. - (Compluters bake.) \
Example 4: Tölva og köttur baka. - (A computer and a cat bake.)

The twist is that similar to how English has *he*, *she*, and *it* depends on the gender of the thing referred to is masculine, feminine, or neuter, Icelandic has three versions of the word they depending on the gender of the things referred to: *þeir*, *þær*, and *þau*. Essentially, you can think of these are plural versions of *hann*, *hún*, or *það*. Put another way, if the *they* is made up of two *hes*, use *þeir*. If it is made up of two *shes*, use *þær*. If it is made up of two *its*, or a mixture of two or more genders, use *þau*. Below, find this explained in a chart. 

| This  | Plus      | Equals |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| hann  | hann      | þeir   |
| hún   | hún       | þær    |
| það   | það       | þau    |
| this* | not this* | þau    |

## Now I Know:
- how conjugation charts are organized
- what person and plurality refer to
- what subject pronouns each cell in a conjugation table refers to
- that Icelandic has three versions of *they* and when they are used
