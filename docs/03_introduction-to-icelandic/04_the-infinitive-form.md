title: The Infinitive Form
---

The infinitive form of a verb is the most common and useful form of a verb to know. 

## The Infinitive Form
As mentioned in the last lesson, verbs conjugate to match their person and their tense. But verbs can also be written in an unconjugated form known as the infinite form. This form does not contain information about who is doing the action, when it is happening, or anything else; it just represents the action itself.

In English, you can recognize the infinitive form by the word **to** appearing before the verb. 

Example 1: **To** eat \
Example 2: **To** bake  
Example 3: **To** talk 

In Icelandic, you can recognize the infinitive form by the word **að** appearing before the verb. 

Example 1: **Að** borða \
Example 2: **Að** baka \
Example 3: **Að** tala 

## The Stem and Ending

Icelandic verbs are made up of two parts: the **stem** and the *ending*. The ending is the part of the word that changes during conjugation. In the infinitive form, this is nearly universally the letter *a*. The stem is the part of the word that comes before the ending. Because the stem stays the same, you can recognize the word in its conjugated forms.

Example 1: Að **tal**a \
Example 2: Þú **tal**ar. \
Example 3: Hann **tal**ar. \
Example 4: Ég **tal**a. 

## Now I Know:
- the infinitive form of a verb is the unconjugated form of the verb
- you can recognize the infinitive form of a verb by the word **að* coming before it
- Icelandic verbs end in *a* in the infinitive form
- what the stem and the ending of a verb are
