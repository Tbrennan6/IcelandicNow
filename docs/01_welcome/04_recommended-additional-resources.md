title: Recommended Additional Resources
---

In addition to this course, I highly recommend checking out two completely free online learning resources. Their prospective creators or curators agreed to their inclusion here.


While you do not have to use these resources, I recommend them for a good reason. They will be a tremendous help when you start to learn inflections. Throughout this course, you will be asked to memorize inflection patterns. This is a difficult task and, hopefully, if I do my job, the most mentally taxing thing you will be asked to do.

## Beygingarlýsing Íslensks Nútímamáls (Inflectional Description Of Modern Iceladic)

Learning inflections is not easy, but with the right tool, it becomes much easier. While you are free to use any tool or method you want, and I implore you to explore what works best for you, there is simply no replacing [BÍN](https://bin.arnastofnun.is/).

BÍN is an online tool created by Stofnun Árna Magnússonar (The Árni Magnússon Foundation), an Icelandic governmental institution dedicated to researching, recording, preserving, Teaching, and sharing the Icelandic Language. With this tool, you can search for and see the inflectional paradigms of nearly any Icelandic word. For its ease of use, comprehensiveness, and polished presentation, BÍN has long been thought of as the most helpful tool for learning Icelandic.

I wrote more about how to use this resource in an article [here](TODO)!

## Íslenzka.is

[Íslenzka.is](https://islenzka.is/) has helped me, and many others, learn Icelandic inflections by allowing you to search up words and providing blank inflection tables that you can fill in for each word. The website also gives you feedback, telling you if your entry was correct or not. It is extremely helpful when it comes to the repetition part necessary for committing anything to memory. 

Every time you learn a new inflectional pattern, I encourage you to practice with this website, filling out the tables for yourself a few times to test your understanding and reinforce your learning.
